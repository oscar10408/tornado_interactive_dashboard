The first event began on the afternoon of Monday, November 28th and ended around midnight on Tuesday, November 29th . A potent upper level low pressure system spinning over the Northern Plains caused a strong surface low pressure system to develop and rapidly race northeast from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes region. This resulted in a strong cold front racing east into and through the ArkLaMiss region. As it did so, it encountered a strongly wind-sheared and marginally unstable air mass over the area. This equated to a line of storms racing east across the ArkLaMiss, that downed numerous trees and powerlines across the area. Numerous trees were also reported down well ahead of the front due to widespread sustained gradient winds between 25-35 mph, gusting between 40-50 mph at times over the ArkLaMiss. After this cold front pushed through the region, it stalled near the central gulf coast Tuesday morning, aiding in setting the stage for the second bout of severe weather that would affect the region from Tuesday afternoon into the early morning hours of Wednesday, November 30th. ||Another piece of upper level energy associated with the low pressure system aloft over the Northern Plains, approached the Southeast United States Tuesday afternoon. As this happened, it caused the front stalled south of the area to begin lifting north through the area as a warm front. As warm moist unstable air overspread the region from the south, both wind shear and forcing over the region became adequate, such that supercell thunderstorms began developing and moving northeast through the area. Numerous storms became severe and produced damaging wind gusts and large hail, primarily ranging from quarter to golfball size.||As a cold front finally pushed east and through the ArkLaMiss early Wednesday morning, severe weather finally came to an end across the entire area around sunrise.",,CSV

The length of the path through Northeast Colorado was approximately 121 miles from southeast Denver to the Yuma County line. The storm produced hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter in southeast Denver. As it moved across northeast Adams County, several power poles were sheared off at the base by straight-line winds, southwest of Leader. Across Morgan County, hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter was observed. The damage path became more extensive as the storm tracked across northern Washington County. Wind driven hail up to 1.75 inches was reported with extensive damage from around Akron east to the Yuma County line. Extensive hail damage included broken windows to cars and homes. Several power poles were snapped near Otis. In all, up to 10 structures were damaged or destroyed from near Platner to the Yuma County line. While some of the damage was tornadic, most of the damage was caused by straight-line winds.  In addition, a severe thunderstorm produced large hail in Jefferson County.",A small but intense tornado touched down and caused significant damage to a pole shed.  The tornado lifted the entire shed and destroyed it. Debris from this shed traveled around 1 mile to the southeast from where the tornado first struck it.

By the afternoon hours, this produced heat index values over 100 degrees in many valley areas, with some spots in the mid-Hudson Valley seeing heat index values approach 110 degrees.||At the same time, a surface cold front was approaching the area from the west.  Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning. Over 50,000 customers lost power at the height of the storms as a result of the gusty winds and lightning strikes.||Thunderstorms ended with the passage of the cold front during the overnight hours.",,CSV

This allowed a very warm and excessively humid air mass to be in place over the area.  As temperatures rose through the 80s and into the 90s, dewpoints were unusually high in the mid to upper 70s.  By the afternoon hours, this produced heat index values over 100 degrees in many valley areas, with some spots in the mid-Hudson Valley seeing heat index values approach 110 degrees.||At the same time, a surface cold front was approaching the area from the west.  Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning. Over 50,000 customers lost power at the height of the storms as a result of the gusty winds and lightning strikes.||Thunderstorms ended with the passage of the cold front during the overnight hours.",Trees were downed on Sheridan Road in the town of Warren due to thunderstorm winds.,CSV

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC. Daily record rainfall totals of were also set on October 7th and October 8th at the Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches, at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.7 inches and 5.77 inches and in downtown Charleston (KCXM), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches respectively. Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th. Damage from surge was most notable on the northern ends of Tybee Island in Georgia, Fripp Island in South Carolina and Edisto Island in South Carolina. Locations on Fripp Island and Edisto Island saw some of the most significant beach erosion and damage to oceanfront homes in the entire area.","An eye witness report during Hurricane Matthew on Edisto Island from a former Meteorolgist-In-Charge of WFO Charleston indicated that there were many large trees and tree limbs down in the area with one huge Water Oak about 90 feet tall and 3 feet in diameter uprooted with the first 25 feet basically sunk into the ground.

By the afternoon hours, this produced heat index values over 100 degrees in many valley areas, with some spots in the mid-Hudson Valley seeing heat index values approach 110 degrees.||At the same time, a surface cold front was approaching the area from the west.  Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning.

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC. Daily record rainfall totals of were also set on October 7th and October 8th at the Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches, at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.7 inches and 5.77 inches and in downtown Charleston (KCXM), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches respectively. Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th. Damage from surge was most notable on the northern ends of Tybee Island in Georgia, Fripp Island in South Carolina and Edisto Island in South Carolina. Locations on Fripp Island and Edisto Island saw some of the most significant beach erosion and damage to oceanfront homes in the entire area.","A Hurricane Matthew NWS storm survey found evidence of inundation along/over U.S. Route 21 at numerous locations, including salt water just south of the Beaufort County Airport to the Harbor River Bridge. Eight boats were driven aground along the north side of U.S. 21. Salt water inundation at the Beaufort County Airport resulted in 4 boats driven onto or along the runway, likely from Dataw Island Marina. Approximately 1 foot of water went into the hangars on the runway during the storm and about 2 ft of water inundation occurred in the parking lot where 6 to 8 cars were damaged. A debris line indicated that the Harbor River pushed over a rock wall and inundated the area. Measurements suggested that the storm surge reached approximately 4 feet at this location. ||The Dataw Island Marina docks on Jenkins Creek were destroyed. Evidence of storm surge and inundation included several boats and much debris driven aground along the south shore of the creek. The south side/northbound lane of Harbor Island Bridge was washed out by surge and the bridge/all points south were closed by a police road block. There was evidence of fast moving surge and inundation on Harbor Island with several homes along North Harbor badly damaged by combination of wind/surge. Two to four structures on the water were likely a total loss. Utilities personnal reported approximately 2 ft inundation at water pumps along Harbor Drive. Measurements estimated surge approximately 5.5 feet and inundation between 2 and 4 ft at beach front along North Harbor Drive.||Hunting Island State Park was not accessible due to downed trees, but aerial photographs depicted sand covered roadways and parking lots accompanied by many downed trees across the state park and along U.S. 21 along north side of island. The pier on the south end of Hunting Island was damaged. ||Evidence of storm surge was found well inland on Fripp Island and the combination of fresh/salt water flooding persisted during the survey. Evidence of fast moving surge/inundation was also found along Porpoise Drive and the waterfront along the northeast side of island, including boulders from the sea wall and sand deposited along the road. Water marks indicated approximately 2 feet of fast-moving surge and splash marks to approximately 3 ft. Measurements at High Dunes Road indicated that surge as high as 6.6 ft could have occurred.||Per a Hurricane Matthew NWS survey on Hilton Head Island, storm surge made it over hole 18 of the Harbour Town Golf Links course and up to the entrances of nearby building/residences on the far side of the fairway. Water did not appear to enter any buildings. In general, a 1-2 ft escarpment was observed on the beaches, particularly at Coligny Beach, but there was no evidence of oceanside buildings damaged along the beach. Local media videos indicated a possible combination of fresh and salt water inundation on streets in Palmetto Hall Plantation.",CSV

On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th. Damage from surge was most notable on the northern ends of Tybee Island in Georgia, Fripp Island in South Carolina and Edisto Island in South Carolina. Locations on Fripp Island and Edisto Island saw some of the most significant beach erosion and damage to oceanfront homes in the entire area.","A Hurricane Matthew NWS storm survey found scattered tree damage and significant power outages in Beaufort. Tree and structural damage increased with southward progress along U.S. 21, especially beginning on St. Helena Island. Damage suggests the eyewall reached this location. Extensive tree damage was seen on Dataw Island, including hundreds of trees, some on several homes. Damage was consistent with wind gusts around 100 mph.||Extensive shingle/roof damage occurred to about 50% of homes on Harbor Island, especially along Harbor Drive and North Harbor Drive. The worst structural damage was consistent with wind gusts 100-110 mph. A combination of wind/surge also badly damaged several waterfront homes along North Harbor Drive.||Hunting Island State Park was not accessible due to downed trees, but aerial photographs depicted  many downed trees across the state park and along U.S. 21 along north side of island. The pier on the south end of Hunting Island was also damaged. ||On Fripp Island, structural damage included significant shingle/roof damage consistent with wind gusts at least 100 mph and major overall structural damage to two waterfront homes at the south end of Porpoise Drive. On another home, garage doors were buckled/damaged by a combination of surge and wind.||On Hilton Head, thousands of trees were snapped/uprooted across the island, with a larger quantity of trees down across the northern end of the island. Several trees fell on structures, causing major damage to homes. Tree damage supported 90-100 mph wind gusts, although gusts could have exceeded 100 mph in some locations. Evidence of tree damage was also seen on aerial imagery. A large swath of hundreds of trees were down in the Palmetto Hall Plantation area just west of Beach City Road. Aerial imagery indicated the trees were down in roughly a northeast to southwest direction, mainly following swamp/marsh areas. Trees likely were uprooted and blown over due to the combination of wet ground and high winds in bands of convection surrounding the western eyewall of Hurricane Matthew as is tracked north along the coast. At 550 AM a peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at Hilton Head Airport (KHXD).",CSV

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC. Daily record rainfall totals of were also set on October 7th and October 8th at the Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches, at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.7 inches and 5.77 inches and in downtown Charleston (KCXM), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches respectively. Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina.

Damage from surge was most notable on the northern ends of Tybee Island in Georgia, Fripp Island in South Carolina and Edisto Island in South Carolina. Locations on Fripp Island and Edisto Island saw some of the most significant beach erosion and damage to oceanfront homes in the entire area.","A Hurricane Matthew NWS storm survey of Edisto Beach revealed at least 70 beach front homes along a 1.5 mile stretch of Palmetto Boulevard damaged by a combination of storm surge and wave action. The most significant damage was along the northern end of Edisto Beach, where most homes were severely undercut with concrete foundations and driveways completely destroyed at ground level. This was the area where Palmetto Blvd makes a right turn toward the south near Pavilion Pier to Osceola Boulevard. One home was also completely destroyed at this location. Water and sand lines indicated 5 to 6 feet of beach erosion at the base of oceanside homes. A few homes also had rock barriers which were damaged and some rocks were washed into the first floor of a home. Farther south along Palmetto Boulevard, homes exhibited shingle, siding and window damage. One home had a broken water pipe that was still spraying water under the first floor. A deck was likely washed away from wooden stairs 10 to 15 feet tall which was no longer attached to any structure.||Approximately 4 to 5 feet of surge was determined to have occurred based on a waterline noted on a home across the street of Palmetto Blvd near the intersection with Osceola. Approximately 2 to 5 feet of sand was pushed onshore and covered a 2-mile stretch of road on Palmetto Blvd. Widespread debris was mixed with the sand, including gas tanks, refrigerators, a/c Units, etc. Further inland, numerous trees and flooded waters remained post storm. Approximately 1 to 2 feet of water was still present further south along Palmetto Boulevard for about a 1 mile stretch. Water also remained under homes on the far side of Palmetto Boulevard and adjacent blocks further inland, likely trapped for several days due to the beachfront elevation giving no way for the water to return to the ocean. Most homes on the far side of Palmetto Boulevard had little to no damage, but several homes on stilts were surrounded by water. A report from the former Meteorologist-In-Charge of WFO Charleston indicated that the front beach of Edisto Beach was basically moved inland a couple of blocks. Even as late as October 16 there were still places under water, but most of the sand had been cleared from the roads.",CSV

Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning.

An upper level trough and associated cold front entered the North Bay early in the day and then moved southward through the entire Bay Area by the afternoon. The passing frontal boundary and cold air aloft help to set the stage for afternoon thunderstorms. Computer weather models forecasted the mid to late afternoon thunderstorm potential rather well. The GFS model imagery below depicts the passage of the upper level trough/low and associated precipitation. The NAM model imagery below depicts forecast surface based convective available potential energy (CAPE). In other words, CAPE is the measure of instability in the lower atmosphere (full definition here). Note the higher values of CAPE over northern Napa County and southern Monterey/San Benito Counties.||The cold frontal passage earlier in the day brought mostly stratiform rain to the Bay Area impacting the morning commute. However, after noon enough instability was present and thunderstorms began to develop over Monterey/San Benito Counties. See the radar animation below. These developing thunderstorms continued to track south and develop even further (remember the NAM CAPE forecast). Through radar interrogation it was determined that this particular thunderstorm contained hail. The question was, how big? After utilizing dual pol radar imagery and radar cross sections evidence was growing that larger hail could be present. One technique meteorologists use for analyzing hail is the strength of the radar returns above 0C and especially - 20C. In the image below, higher returns were easily seen above the 0C line and -20C. As a result, a Severe Thunderstorm Warning was issued with the main threats being hail of one inch and wind gusts to 60 mph. We had one report of hail associated with thunderstorm. Enough hail fell to cover the ground white and make it look like it snowed (picture).||Another notable thunderstorm that developed during the afternoon was located over northern Napa County (remember the NAM CAPE forecast). Thunderstorms developed north of Lake Berryessa and began tracking south(see radar image below). This particular thunderstorm eventually began to indicate weak rotation. The rotation detected on the KDAX radar ended up being a short-live waterspout. Confirmation of the waterspout was eventually reported via social media (see picture). In short, a waterspout is a tornado over water (full definition here).",Waterspout formed on lake Berryessa during cold frontal passage. This was filmed by people visiting the lake and was only a blip on the radar due to distance and elevation from the radar. |LSR: https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/wx/afos/p.php?pil=LSRMTR&e=201604281650 .|Write up: http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mtr/stormSummary/SvrWx4_27_16/svrwx_4_27_16.php .,CSV

An upper level trough and associated cold front entered the North Bay early in the day and then moved southward through the entire Bay Area by the afternoon. The passing frontal boundary and cold air aloft help to set the stage for afternoon thunderstorms. Computer weather models forecasted the mid to late afternoon thunderstorm potential rather well. The GFS model imagery below depicts the passage of the upper level trough/low and associated precipitation. The NAM model imagery below depicts forecast surface based convective available potential energy (CAPE). In other words, CAPE is the measure of instability in the lower atmosphere (full definition here). Note the higher values of CAPE over northern Napa County and southern Monterey/San Benito Counties.||The cold frontal passage earlier in the day brought mostly stratiform rain to the Bay Area impacting the morning commute. However, after noon enough instability was present and thunderstorms began to develop over Monterey/San Benito Counties. See the radar animation below. These developing thunderstorms continued to track south and develop even further (remember the NAM CAPE forecast). Through radar interrogation it was determined that this particular thunderstorm contained hail. The question was, how big? After utilizing dual pol radar imagery and radar cross sections evidence was growing that larger hail could be present. One technique meteorologists use for analyzing hail is the strength of the radar returns above 0C and especially - 20C. In the image below, higher returns were easily seen above the 0C line and -20C. As a result, a Severe Thunderstorm Warning was issued with the main threats being hail of one inch and wind gusts to 60 mph. We had one report of hail associated with thunderstorm. Enough hail fell to cover the ground white and make it look like it snowed (picture).||Another notable thunderstorm that developed during the afternoon was located over northern Napa County (remember the NAM CAPE forecast). Thunderstorms developed north of Lake Berryessa and began tracking south(see radar image below). This particular thunderstorm eventually began to indicate weak rotation. The rotation detected on the KDAX radar ended up being a short-live waterspout. Confirmation of the waterspout was eventually reported via social media (see picture). In short, a waterspout is a tornado over water (full definition here).","Began to see reports via social media of localized, low level urban flooding due to heavy rain and hail, so we investigated. To attain some ground truth, WCM called petro facility that the convection crossed. He spoke with the plant supervisor who was from Texas and knows severe weather. The supervisor was able to provide photos and video of the hail falling and accumulating. He said at its peak, the hail had depths of about 3 inches, but just under dime size at most. The hail melted quickly and caused local ponding of water.||No impacts were reported.|See http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mtr/stormSummary/SvrWx4_27_16/svrwx_4_27_16.php for pics and details.",CSV

A double wide mobile home was completely destroyed and an adjacent church roof was heavily damaged. The tornado passed through a grove of trees snapping nearly all of them halfway up the trunk. The strong tornado passed through a farm and caused significant damage to a two story family home. This part of the tornado path was determined to be at the high end of the EF-2 rating. As the tornado continued along a northeasterly track, two additional homes were heavily damaged before moving along an unpopulated ridge. The tornado likely skipped along this ridge as it crossed Highway 127 and then crossed Highway 111. A mobile home roof was completely removed near the corner of Shell Road and Tri Mile Road along with numerous trees that were either uprooted or snapped. The damage track seemed to end near Snow Bird Lane and Raven Cliff Road. Rear flank downdraft damage was noted farther east along Lewis Chapel Road to about Laurelwood Trail.

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days.

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day.

Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall.

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC.

Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina.

Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day.

Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall.

Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th. Damage from surge was most notable on the northern ends of Tybee Island in Georgia, Fripp Island in South Carolina and Edisto Island in South Carolina. Locations on Fripp Island and Edisto Island saw some of the most significant beach erosion and damage to oceanfront homes in the entire area.","More than 30 dune walkovers were either significantly damaged or totally destroyed by Hurricane Matthew on the south end of Isle of Palms. Most dunes were eroded with escarpments as large as 6 to 8 feet. The public also reported Whitepoint Gardens on the Charleston Battery in downtown Charleston inundated by storm surge.|The Charleston Harbor tide gauge recorded a peak tide of 9.29 ft MLLW at 148 AM on October 8th, which was the 3rd highest all storm tide on record at this location.

Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day.

Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew.

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast.

Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall.

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC.

Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th.
