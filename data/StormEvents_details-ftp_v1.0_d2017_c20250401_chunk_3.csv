The highest rainfall total was 29.19 inches outside of LaGrange in Fayette County. A number of places in Fayette, Lavaca, and Bastrop Counties received 20 or more inches of rain. Tropical storm force winds with estimated gusts up to 60 mph caused damage across the region. Trees and branches were knocked down by the winds. Some of these in turn knocked down power lines causing power outages in Bastrop, Comal, Hays, and Guadalupe Counties. At one point, 15,000 customers in Comal County were without power. There was also some minor structural damage in Caldwell, Comal, and Lavaca Counties. Maximum rainfall totals in these counties ranged from 4.67 inches in Bexar to 29.19 in Fayette. Flooding and flash flooding forced 608 people to be evacuated from their homes. Most of these, 400, were in Fayette County.","The largest impact across Lee County with Harvey was the rainfall where as much as 20 inches fell near Giddings.  The southern half of the county experienced the worst flooding with 25 homes being impacted, many of those having experienced major damage.

Nate quickly weakened as it moved inland across inland southeast Mississippi and southwest Alabama and was downgraded to a tropical depression over central Alabama by 10am CDT on October 8th.||The most significant damage produced by Nate was a substantial storm surge, particularly in the Mississippi Sound and Mobile Bay. The highest surge values were observed in Mobile County, AL where peak surge inundation was generally 4 to 6 feet based on official tide gauges. However, an NWS Mobile storm survey indicated a peak surge inundation of 6 to 8 feet along the immediate coastal areas of Bayou La Batre and Coden. Similar inundation levels occurred on the west end of Dauphin Island. 3 to 6 feet of inundation occurred in Baldwin County, with the highest surge occurring along the eastern shore of Mobile Bay and points further north in the Mobile River Delta. Approximately 25 homes on the west end of Dauphin Island were significantly flooded by the surge waters. Several other homes experienced minor damage from the surge. Several homes in the Bayou La Batre, Coden, and the Dog River area of Mobile County experienced 2 to 3 feet of flooding inside the structures due to the surge. Hundreds of piers were damaged or destroyed n Mobile and Baldwin Counties. Some coastal roads were also closed due to surge, including the US Highway 90 Causeway and Water Street in Downtown Mobile. The surge and large breaking waves also resulted in significant beach erosion along the gulf facing beaches. 6 feet of sand was deposited on a 3 mile stretch of Bienville Blvd on the west end of Dauphin Island. ||Winds gusts of 50+ mph were observed in coastal areas with a the highest wind gust of 66 mph recorded at the Mobile Regional Airport just after 2am on October 8th. The winds resulted mainly in scattered power outages and downed trees. Gusty winds did spread further inland into southwest and south central Alabama with isolated to scattered power outages and downed trees reported. ||The fast movement of Nate resulted in limited, if any, impacts from flooding. 3 to 6 inches of rain was reported across southwest and south central Alabama, with the highest totals occurring in Mobile and Baldwin Counties. ||Four EF-0 tornadoes were reported in southwest and south central Alabama: one in Mobile County, two in Baldwin County, and one in Butler County.||2 rip current fatalities occurred on October 9th in Fort Morgan due to continued high surf and widespread rip currents left in the wake of the hurricane.||Based on available information from public and individual assistance reports, total damage from Hurricane Nate in southwest Alabama is roughly estimated at just over $21 million, with the vast majority of the damage resulting from surge and major beach erosion in Mobile and Baldwin Counties.",,CSV

A damage path a found extending from Zanot Road east-southeastward to the intersection of Cherry Run Road and Rimer Road to Fink Road in Toby Township, roughly 4 miles northwest of Rimersburg.  Observed damage was exclusively to trees, with many examples of broken large limbs, trunk snaps, and uproots of both healthy and unhealthy trees. The most significant damage occurred during the early part of the track along Zanot Road to its intersection with Cherry Run Road.  It was here that the greatest concentration of tree damage was found, with several healthy trees snapped and uprooted.  A convergent damage path was noted, as opposed to a uniform or spreading direction, which suggested tornadic activity.  Further down the track, tree damage was less significant and limited to smaller trees. While tree damage was significant, especially in the first portion of the track, the overall lack of damage to structures plus the antecedent wet soils allows the wind speed to be capped at 75 MPH.

Numerous reports of large hail and damaging winds were received with these storms before all of the storms exited the area by early evening.||Due to high amounts of instability in the atmosphere and unusually steep lapse rates aloft, very large hail was reported in several areas. Some of the largest hail was reported in Lewisburg, where hail up to 2 inches in diameter covered the ground and caused significant damage to roofs and vehicles. Golf ball size hail was also reported in Waynesboro (Wayne County), with ping pong ball size hail in Hampshire (Maury County) and Summertown (Lawrence County).||Some of the worst wind damage occurred along a segment of the MCS called a bow echo, which is commonly associated with damaging winds. This bow echo moved from Williamson and Rutherford Counties across Cannon, Coffee, Warren, Van Buren, and Grundy Counties during the late afternoon hours. Based on damage reports, photos, and radar data, winds are estimated to have reached over 90 mph in parts of these counties. Damage included a roof blown off a school in Christiana (Rutherford County); numerous trees and power poles snapped, a tractor trailer blown over onto a car, and structural damage to a few homes in Murfreesboro (Rutherford County); structural damage to homes and barns being destroyed near the Iconium community (Cannon County); numerous trees falling on campers and RVs in Fall Creek Falls State Park (Van Buren County); and numerous trees, power lines, and power poles knocked down in Manchester (Coffee County).",Lightning was responsible for a small fire at a church on North Main Street in Cornersville.,CSV

This MCS moved into Middle Tennessee around 230 PM CDT, and additional scattered thunderstorms also developed out ahead of the MCS. Numerous reports of large hail and damaging winds were received with these storms before all of the storms exited the area by early evening.||Due to high amounts of instability in the atmosphere and unusually steep lapse rates aloft, very large hail was reported in several areas. Some of the largest hail was reported in Lewisburg, where hail up to 2 inches in diameter covered the ground and caused significant damage to roofs and vehicles. Golf ball size hail was also reported in Waynesboro (Wayne County), with ping pong ball size hail in Hampshire (Maury County) and Summertown (Lawrence County).||Some of the worst wind damage occurred along a segment of the MCS called a bow echo, which is commonly associated with damaging winds. This bow echo moved from Williamson and Rutherford Counties across Cannon, Coffee, Warren, Van Buren, and Grundy Counties during the late afternoon hours. Based on damage reports, photos, and radar data, winds are estimated to have reached over 90 mph in parts of these counties. Damage included a roof blown off a school in Christiana (Rutherford County); numerous trees and power poles snapped, a tractor trailer blown over onto a car, and structural damage to a few homes in Murfreesboro (Rutherford County); structural damage to homes and barns being destroyed near the Iconium community (Cannon County); numerous trees falling on campers and RVs in Fall Creek Falls State Park (Van Buren County); and numerous trees, power lines, and power poles knocked down in Manchester (Coffee County).",,CSV

Numerous reports of large hail and damaging winds were received with these storms before all of the storms exited the area by early evening.||Due to high amounts of instability in the atmosphere and unusually steep lapse rates aloft, very large hail was reported in several areas. Some of the largest hail was reported in Lewisburg, where hail up to 2 inches in diameter covered the ground and caused significant damage to roofs and vehicles. Golf ball size hail was also reported in Waynesboro (Wayne County), with ping pong ball size hail in Hampshire (Maury County) and Summertown (Lawrence County).||Some of the worst wind damage occurred along a segment of the MCS called a bow echo, which is commonly associated with damaging winds. This bow echo moved from Williamson and Rutherford Counties across Cannon, Coffee, Warren, Van Buren, and Grundy Counties during the late afternoon hours.

Widespread tropical storm force winds with gusts to hurricane force were felt across much of the area, with the strongest winds surging up the Florida east coast during the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 11th. Extensive tree and power line damage occurred across the local area from the winds. One of the greatest local impacts exacerbated by Irma's rainfall and storm surge was river flooding. Prior to Irma's arrival, a local nor'eastern developed 3 days prior, with strong onshore flow pumping water into the St. Johns River basin. Elevated water levels of 1-2 ft above normal tidal departure were already ongoing for several tidal cycles before Irma's surge and rainfall. The nor'easter also brought localized heavy rainfall bands, with some areas near the coast realizing 4-6 inches in 24 hrs the days prior to Irma. In addition, precursor conditions to the nor'easter included an above average rainfall across the region during the summer months.  Major, historic river flooding was forecast along Black Creek and the Sante Fe a week prior to Irma. Realized river values along the St. Johns surpassed prior record levels set by Hurricane Dora in 1964, during low tide the morning of Sept. 11th. The St. Johns River basin continued to rise with the combination of trapped tides due to the nor'easter, astronomically high tides heading into the spring tide season, storm surge of up to 5 ft in some areas, fresh water rainfall of 7-11 inches, and strong southerly winds pushing the water across the basin on the east side of Irma. Historic river flooding occurred across much of NE Florida Sept 11th through the following week as water levels were slow to funnel out of the St. Johns basin. Coastal infrastructure that was already weakened about 1 year ago due to Hurricane Matthew suffered the most damage from Irma's storm surge.","This narrative is from the NWS Jacksonville Post Storm Report for Hurricane Irma which is a compiled list of reports from the storm survey, Emergency Management, private and public weather observation networks and broadcast media sources.||Santa Fe River at Worthington Springs set a record flood stage at 71.17 feet on Sept 12th at 2200 EDT.

Widespread tropical storm force winds with gusts to hurricane force were felt across much of the area, with the strongest winds surging up the Florida east coast during the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 11th. Extensive tree and power line damage occurred across the local area from the winds. One of the greatest local impacts exacerbated by Irma's rainfall and storm surge was river flooding. Prior to Irma's arrival, a local nor'eastern developed 3 days prior, with strong onshore flow pumping water into the St. Johns River basin. Elevated water levels of 1-2 ft above normal tidal departure were already ongoing for several tidal cycles before Irma's surge and rainfall. The nor'easter also brought localized heavy rainfall bands, with some areas near the coast realizing 4-6 inches in 24 hrs the days prior to Irma. In addition, precursor conditions to the nor'easter included an above average rainfall across the region during the summer months.  Major, historic river flooding was forecast along Black Creek and the Sante Fe a week prior to Irma. Realized river values along the St. Johns surpassed prior record levels set by Hurricane Dora in 1964, during low tide the morning of Sept. 11th. The St. Johns River basin continued to rise with the combination of trapped tides due to the nor'easter, astronomically high tides heading into the spring tide season, storm surge of up to 5 ft in some areas, fresh water rainfall of 7-11 inches, and strong southerly winds pushing the water across the basin on the east side of Irma. Historic river flooding occurred across much of NE Florida Sept 11th through the following week as water levels were slow to funnel out of the St. Johns basin. Coastal infrastructure that was already weakened about 1 year ago due to Hurricane Matthew suffered the most damage from Irma's storm surge.",This tornado may have initiated as a water spout that moved onshore at Vilano Beach. Minimal damage was reported in Vilano Beach with greater tree damage discovered west of Vilano Beach where a few trees were snapped and uprooted.

The most notable of the tornadoes were the EF-2 and EF-3 tornadoes that impacted Smithville, Missouri and Oak Grove, Missouri respectively. According to news reports there were 12 injuries associated with the Oak Grove tornado, but despite the widespread significant damage there were no fatalities. As the line of storms moved eastward several embedded supercells and mesovortices produced several more tornadoes across northern and central Missouri. By the end of the event, officially there were four EF-1 tornadoes, one EF-2 tornado (Smithville, MO), one EF-3 (Oak Grove, MO), and five EF-0 tornadoes in Missouri. The Leawood Kansas tornado was rated EF-0 as well, rounding out the 12 confirmed tornadoes in the EAX CWA from that evening.","This tornado is a continuation of the tornado that moved out of Clay County after impacting Smithville and Smithville Lake on the night of March 6. The tornado reached its strongest rating and its widest size as it crossed out of Clay County into Clinton County while it crossed Smithville Lake. Like in Clay County several residences were impacted in Clinton County by this large tornado that reached 1000 yards wide at its largest point. The worst of the damage occurred just east of Smithville lake where numerous structures were completely destroyed, but like on the west side of the lake the worst of the damage seemed to occur where garage doors became a point of entry for 100+ mph winds and lifted the entire structure off of its foundation.   The tornado continued across the rural portions of Clinton County, remaining at least EF-2 until it approached Lathrop, where it became smaller and didn't create as much damage. A few structures on the south end of Lathrop were damaged. The last damage point appeared to be just west of Interstate 35, where a few metal outbuildings had some metal peeled off, but no more damage was located east of I-35.

The storm traveled north through southwest Florida through the evening. Effects from Irma were felt across South Florida from September 9th through September 11th. Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Initial and incomplete damage estimate across the area is estimated to be around $800 million, but in all likelihood will be much higher once damage assessments are completed. $222.5 million in damage came in from Collier County, and about $300 million from Palm Beach County.

I have pictures of the tree fall on my street and reports of similar from near neighbors. The points where the wind took the trees down are very small, very well defined areas. There are large, untouched stands of trees immediately around the confined area where concentrated groups of trees came down. The people in the houses at those sites report one very brief, momentary, horrific battering of the wind and immediate tree fall.||Addition: In conversations later in the day my neighbors mentioned that the wind and rain were going sideways.. and that people at the front and the back of the house saw the wind and rain coming from opposite directions, .. as though the house was in the center with wind circling around it.",CSV

The feeder bands produced several modes of severe weather, including tornadoes, straight line winds, and flash flooding.","NWS Meteorologists surveyed damage in western Jefferson County and found that the damage was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 110 mph. There were three separate notable increases in damage severity and/or density, likely indicating that the funnel had a skipping/cycling characteristic as it swayed from less to more intense.||The tornado touched down along 5th Street North, between Highway 11 and Avenue A, where damage ranged from broken large limbs to uprooted and snapped trees. The tornado then traveled northeast with a long swath of damage centered along a track generally between Interstate 20/59 and Highway 11. Aside from continued uprooting of trees and downing of limbs, the first notable damage occurred just west of Western Hills Mall, where there was hefty damage to an Express Oil Change, Alabama ABC store, and mini strip mall, along Dr. M.L.K. Boulevard. Damage at this location was likely the result of a short-lived, concentrated vortex, with a track around 300 yards in length and EF1 intensity. Beyond this point, damage fell into EF0 range.||The tornado continued knocking down trees as it moved northeast, with some trees falling onto homes, resulting in severe roof damage. Tornadic winds also caused minor to moderate roof damage ranging from missing shingles to sections of roof damaged or blown off, especially in neighborhoods adjacent to Miles College (to the south and northeast). Given a noticeable increase in damage density, it is possible that the tornado briefly intensified in this area, over the course of roughly a 700 yard path. While there was an obvious increase in the amount of uprooted trees, there was a large contribution from shallow root systems and especially saturated soil conditions; thus, given a lack of notable wind-driven damage to homes (which held in EF0, characteristic of shingle and roof trim damage), the overall damage pattern did not tip the scale for a small corridor of EF1 rating.||Next, the tornado neared and crossed Interstate 20/59 where the extent of damage backed off, though some minor structural damage done to the Tire Tech car bay, and Freeway Honda. Windows were also blown out of a few cars at the Honda dealership. An increase in the number of uprooted trees was again observed surrounding Tuxedo Park on the north side of Interstate 20/59, along with roof damage to a few homes. Tornado damage became very sporadic and increasingly less significant as the tornado neared Bankhead Highway, dissipating near the CSX Transportation railways adjacent to Pratt Highway.",CSV
